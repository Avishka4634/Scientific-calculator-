# Scientific Calculator with Python and Tkinter

Welcome to the Scientific Calculator project! This application is a graphical user interface (GUI) based calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. It supports both basic arithmetic operations and advanced mathematical functions, all presented in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- **Advanced Mathematical Functions**:
  - Exponentiation
  - Modulus
  - Logarithm (base 10) and Natural Logarithm
  - Square Root
  - Trigonometric Functions: Sine, Cosine, Tangent, and their Inverses
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and mathematical errors.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project is compatible with Python 3.x versions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scientific-calculator.git
   cd scientific-calculator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: The calculator relies on Python's standard libraries, so no additional installations are required.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

2. **Using the Calculator**:

   - Input numbers and select operations using the on-screen buttons.
   - For advanced functions like logarithms or trigonometric calculations, input the number and then press the corresponding function button.
   - The calculator will display the result immediately after an operation is performed.

## Code Overview

The application is structured as follows:

- **calculator.py**: The main script that initializes the GUI and handles user interactions.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to enhance the calculator or fix issues, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName
   ```
3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m 'Add some feature'
   ```
4. Push to the branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/YourFeatureName
   ```
5. Open a pull request.
